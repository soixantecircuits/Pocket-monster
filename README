The two main files are index.php, the user's panel that allow him to see informations about worlds, families, etc... The page will be blank if any world is added.

The other one is admin.php, which allow an user to administrate the database. He can for instance create a world, create a family linked to a world, and a monster linked to a family. The first page is for naming and choosing a family/world. After that, the user can choose to upload a picture from his computer on the server or leave it blank and then the default picture will be use.

The exported scheme of the sql database used is within the repository.
